```
node-libuuid#generate_random x 5,501,355 ops/sec ±1.32% (100 runs sampled)
node-uuid#v4 x 201,565 ops/sec ±2.84% (84 runs sampled)
Fastest is node-libuuid#generate_random

node-libuuid#v1 x 5,434,475 ops/sec ±1.85% (97 runs sampled)
node-uuid#v1 x 1,028,694 ops/sec ±1.91% (94 runs sampled)
Fastest is node-libuuid#v1
